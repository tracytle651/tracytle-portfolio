# Kaggle's Ames House Prices Competition

This project explores predictive modeling using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. The objective is to build a regression model that accurately estimates residential property sale prices based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative features.

This project was completed using R and includes all stages of the machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the Ames dataset for modeling
- Engineer relevant features and handle categorical variables
- Explore and visualize key variables influencing home prices
- Apply and compare multiple regression models
- Evaluate performance using root mean squared error (RMSE)

## Methodology

The analysis includes the following steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and relationships
- Data cleaning, including treatment of missing values and outliers
- Feature transformation and encoding
- Model training using linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression
- Model selection based on cross-validation performance

## Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ames_modeling.R` | R script for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and modeling |
| `ames_housing_report.pdf` | Final report summarizing approach, model results, and insights |
| `submission.csv` | Sample prediction submission



## Key Takeaways

- Demonstrated practical data preprocessing and feature engineering skills
- Applied and interpreted regularized regression techniques in a real-world dataset
- Evaluated and compared model performance using cross-validation metrics
- Gained experience translating raw housing data into actionable insights

For additional context, this project was based on the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle, commonly used as an alternative to the Boston Housing dataset due to its richness and relevance.
