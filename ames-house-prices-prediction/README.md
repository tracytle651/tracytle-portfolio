# Kaggle's Ames House Prices Competition

This project explores predictive modeling using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. The objective is to build a regression model that accurately estimates residential property sale prices based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative features.

This project was completed using R and includes all stages of the machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Methodology

The analysis includes the following steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and relationships
- Data cleaning, including treatment of missing values and outliers
- Feature transformation and encoding
- Model training using various machine learning techniques such as linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression
- Evaluate model performance using root mean squared error (RMSE)

## Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ames_modeling.R` | R script for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and modeling |
| `ames_housing_report.pdf` | Final report summarizing approach, model results, and insights |
| `submission.csv` | Sample prediction submission



## Key Takeaways

- Demonstrated practical data preprocessing and feature engineering skills
- Applied and interpreted regularized regression techniques in a real-world dataset
- Evaluated and compared model performance using cross-validation metrics
- Gained experience translating raw housing data into actionable insights

For additional context, this project was based on the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle, commonly used as an alternative to the Boston Housing dataset due to its richness and relevance.
