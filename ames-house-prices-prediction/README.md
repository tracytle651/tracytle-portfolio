# Kaggle's Ames House Prices Competition

This project explores predictive modeling using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. The objective is to build a regression model that accurately estimates residential property sale prices based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative features.

This project was completed using R and includes all stages of the machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Methodology

The analysis includes the following steps:

- Performing exploratory data analysis to identify variable distributions, patterns, and relationships
- Cleaning the dataset by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
- Transforming and encoding features to prepare the data for modeling
- Training multiple regression models, including linear, ridge, and lasso regression
- Assessing model performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric
