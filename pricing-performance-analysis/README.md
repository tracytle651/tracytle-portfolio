# Pricing Performance Analysis for a Regional Retail Store

This project analyzes pricing performance for a regional secondhand retail store based in San Antonio. The objective was to assess how pricing strategy impacted item sales and store performance, using historical sales data. The project focused on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive dashboard development.

This work was conducted as part of the BAT-3303 Business Consulting course and has been anonymized for confidentiality.

## Research Questions

**RQ1.** By the SKU, what are the sales rankings by different price points? How do different price points influence whether a product is sold or pulled?

**RQ2.** After determining the above, how does the rate of sales reflect on the pricing associate? Is the associate with the most sales aligned with the most sold price point?

**RQ3.** How do pricing associates’ items perform when they reach the sales floor?

**RQ4.** How well and effectively do employees make pricing decisions and adhere to the store’s pricing guidelines?

**RQ5.** How do associates’ pricing decisions differ between stores?

**RQ6.** Using the last two years of data, how did the change in pricing process (finalized in 2023) impact the production numbers at each store location?
