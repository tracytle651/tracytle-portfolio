# Pricing Performance Analysis for a Regional Retail Store

This project analyzes pricing performance for a regional secondhand retail store based in San Antonio. The objective was to assess how pricing strategy impacted item sales and store performance, using historical sales data. The project focused on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive dashboard development.

This work was conducted as part of the BAT-3303 Business Consulting course and has been anonymized for confidentiality.

## Methodology

The project followed a practical analytics workflow that included:

- Cleaning raw transactional data by handling duplicates, missing entries, and inconsistent formats  
- Performing exploratory analysis to identify sales patterns, price sensitivity, and inventory turnover  
- Segmenting data by product type, pricing tiers, and time periods to assess performance trends  
- Creating an interactive dashboard to present findings and support decision-making for retail managers

The analysis focused on identifying which pricing approaches aligned best with inventory movement, and where adjustments could improve turnover or margin.
